# Lisp_Exercises
Two small exercises completed as a courtesy to a friend, written in Lisp.

The first exercise provides information about Antoni Gaud√≠ using recursion and iteration.

The second exercise defines geometric shapes using CLOS. Specifically, it uses inheritance, instance creation, slot accessors and object manipulation.
